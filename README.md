# MLCourse-LU-A1
This repository contains the exercises and questions for assignment 1.

## How to start
* Start by cloning this repository to your computer. 
* You can do the assignment on your own computer, or use Google Colab.
    1. To run it **locally**, make sure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Try running `jupyter notebook` from the command line. 
       
       * If it works, open `A1.ipynb` and continue with the explanations and tasks there.
       
        * If that doesn't work, you first have to install Jupyter notebook. You may also have to install other packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and `pytest`.

If you have difficulty installing a needed package, we recommend asking for help during one of the workgroup sessions.
